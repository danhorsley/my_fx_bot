# FX Bot

## What does FX bot do and what is its use case?

FX Bot lets the user choose froom a number of strategies and risk management methodologies and test them over a number of 'possible futures' generated by a basic Monte Carlo simualtion.  It then applies them to currency 'pairs' of your choice to see how they perform.  

## What is a Monte Carlo simulation?

Just a fancy way of saying we use past events to predict possoble future scenarios.  Imagine every day from a period in the past is represented by a number on a (large!) roulette wheel.  We then spin that wheel multiple times to generate a possible future, with each spin representing the next day in the future.  Obviously this aprroach is not flawless as certain types of days can 'chain' together (see 'Possible Improvements' section below)

## What is a trend following strategy?

Trend following is one of the most dominant strategies gloablly , especially among large algorithmacially driven funds.  

## What is a mean reversion strategy?

This strategy attempts to take advantage of market participants habit of over-reacting in the short term.
Generally short-term in nature these trade strategies use several approaches.  FX Bot uses one of the simplest : when the current price is over one standard deviation away from the rolling average a trade is inititaed looking to profit from the current price closing the gap to the moving average.

## How does FX Bot work?

Initially it relied heavily on the Pandas library.  However this libarary is computationally slow and hit up against the maximum request time length (30 seconds) but also slug size on Heroku (soft limit 300Mb, hard limit 500Mb).  The code was refactored to use Numpy exclusively and also we used our own function for the linear regression function (initially we used the function in the scikit-learn library)
