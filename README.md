# FX Bot

## What does FX bot do and what is its use case?

FX Bot lets the user choose froom a number of strategies and risk management methodologies and test them over a number of 'possible futures' generated by a basic Monte Carlo simualtion.  It then applies them to currency 'pairs' of your choice to see how they perform. 

## What's a currency pair?

In foreign exchange land, a currency's price is only referenced with respect to another currency.  For example 'EURUSD' means how many dollars would you receive for one Euro.  Order matters.  'USDEUR' would be one over whatever the EURUSD price was.  Other common currency pairs are USDJPY, GBPUSD and EURJPY.  These are also the standard wway they ar quoted in.

## What is a Monte Carlo simulation?

Just a fancy way of saying we use past events to predict possoble future scenarios.  Imagine every day from a period in the past is represented by a number on a (large!) roulette wheel.  We then spin that wheel multiple times to generate a possible future, with each spin representing the next day in the future.  Obviously this aprroach is not flawless as certain types of days can 'chain' together in reality (see 'Possible Improvements' section below) and the future is never an exact replication of the past.  Despite these problems, it is a very useful tool for testing trading strategies, portfolio construction and risk limits.

## What is a trend following strategy?

The premise that if things are goign one way, they tend to keep goign that way!  We determine this by fitting a line through a certain number of days in a past 'window' (e.g. 30 days) and check how closely that line fits the historical prices, using an R2 score.  If that score meets a certain threshold a trade is inititated to capture a future move in the same direction.  It is then closed when that trend is no longer adhered to by the underlying reality! Trend following is one of the most dominant strategies gloablly , especially among large algorithmacially driven equity focused funds.  

## What is a mean reversion strategy?

This strategy attempts to take advantage of market participants habit of over-reacting in the short term.
Generally short-term in nature these trade strategies use several approaches.  FX Bot uses one of the simplest : when the current price is over one standard deviation away from the rolling average a trade is inititaed looking to profit from the current price closing the gap to the moving average.

## How does FX Bot work?

Initially it relied heavily on the Pandas library.  However this libarary is computationally slow and hit up against the maximum request time length (30 seconds) but also slug size on Heroku (soft limit 300Mb, hard limit 500Mb).  The code was refactored to use Numpy exclusively and also we used our own function for the linear regression function (initially we used the function in the scikit-learn library)

## Possible Improvements

The reader will undoubtably have noticed that there is no point testing the success or failiure of these trading strategies in random futures generated in this way as trends and mean reversion will not work the same way they do in reality.  There is a solution to this which is not too hard to implement.  This is called [Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) and is a way of more accurately simulating the future.  It imagines the past in a number of chains - the financial crisis would be one chain, the dotcom bubble another etc - and when you are in one chain you most probably remain in that chain on a day to day basis.  But each day you have a certain probability of transitioning to another chain entirely.  This improved Monte Carlo simulation more closely resembles reality as whn you are in a certain chain you only sample from days in the same chain from the historical data.  Trend following and mean reversion would be tested in conditions much closer to reality if we used this.

Other improvements would be to add hourly or minutely data, non FX related securities
